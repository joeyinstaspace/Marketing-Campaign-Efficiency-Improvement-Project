# Marketing-Campaign-Efficiency-Improvement-Project

Introduction:
In this project, we aim to improve the marketing campaign efficiency of a business based on a Marketing Campaign dataset found on Kaggle. We will develop predictive models using Python and showcase various data visualizations to analyze the customer characteristics in the supplied dataset. Our end goal is to identify and precisely forecast the subscription behavior of the customers in this given business’ marketing campaign. In other words, to predict who will respond to an offer for a product or service. By analyzing the characteristics of the customers in this dataset, we hope to identify the business’s ideal customers. This will help the business better understand its customers to modify its product offerings according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of its customers. Furthermore, our analysis can help this business decide if they could tailor specific campaigns and promotions to their ideal customers to increase this business’ marketing campaign efficiency and boost the response rate of future marketing campaigns.
